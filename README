Work on this project has only just begun, and anyone who feels up for the
challenge is more than welcome to help out. 

The design concept thus far is to create a traditional Dead Man's Switch,
for which the user will be capable of choosing the amount of time before
the switch is activated and the preconfigured actions are executed 
automatically by the program. Implementation features for configurable
executable actions should include tasks like deleting the Contact List on
the user's phone, deleting emails (either on the phone or through ssh on
a remote server), deleting all contents of a remote server (or shutting
it down in the case of a remote server with full-disk encryption which
has sensitive information). Features should be added depending on what
activists will need from a Dead Man's Switch in the event of arrest or
incapacitation.

It was discussed among the developers involved with March Hare 
Communications that, in the United States, activists' phones are often
imaged upon intake to jail or other "correctional" facilities, which
requires the phone to be shut down. This creates problems for the 
design implementation in this application, because, in the event that
the user's phone is turned off, the Dead Man's Switch would be unable
to execute the specified tasks. The only way I can imagine getting 
around this is to set up a server somewhere, which stores a set of
actions to be taken in the event that the user's phone does not contact
the server to postpone events within the set ammount of time. A useful
thing to do with this as well would be to have the application tell
the phone to send out a zomg-my-phone-is-dying message when the 
battery reaches a critical level, so that the user's affinity group
at least has some information that the Dead Man's Switch may have
been triggered due to the user's phone being dead.

* Wrote timer function with user configurable time before switch is
  activated
* Switch being activated doesn't do anything at all at this point
  except display a message to the user which reads "Switch Activated."
  Hella useful, right? Shut up, I'm working on it.
* The main screen of the application at this point simply says, "Fuck
  tha five oh" and nothing more, and buttons and interfaces have not
  yet been configured to transfer the user to new activities.
